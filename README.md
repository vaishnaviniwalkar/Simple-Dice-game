## 📌 About the Project

This is a beginner-friendly dice game where:

- Two dice are rolled randomly on page load  
- The player with the higher number wins  
- If both dice show the same number, it's a draw  

I created this project while learning web development and practicing JavaScript logic and DOM manipulation.
